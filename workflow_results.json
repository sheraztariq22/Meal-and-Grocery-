In a medium pot, combine rinsed rice with 1 \u00be cups water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-18 minutes, or until all water is absorbed. Remove from heat and let sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and set aside to keep warm.\n2.  **Prepare the Chicken:** Pat the chicken dry with paper towels (this helps it brown nicely). Cut into bite-sized pieces (about 1-inch cubes or thin strips). Season lightly with salt and pepper.\n3.  **Chop the Vegetables:**\n    *   Cut broccoli into small, bite-sized florets.\n    *   Peel carrots and slice thinly on the bias (at an angle), or julienne into matchsticks.\n    *   Core and seed the bell pepper, then slice into thin strips.\n    *   Peel and slice the onion into thin wedges.\n    *   Peel and mince the garlic (chop very finely).\n    *   Peel and finely grate or mince the ginger.\n4.  **Make the Stir Fry Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, cornstarch, brown sugar, rice vinegar (if using), sesame oil (if using), and 2 tablespoons of water or chicken broth until smooth and no lumps of cornstarch remain. Set aside.\n\n**Phase 2: Cook the Stir Fry**\n\n1.  **Cook the Chicken:** Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in your large skillet or wok over medium-high heat until it's shimmering (just starting to smoke lightly). Add the chicken in a single layer (cook in two batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding, which steams the chicken instead of searing it). Cook for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through. Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside on a clean plate.\n2.  **Cook the Vegetables:** Add another tablespoon of vegetable oil to the same skillet (if needed). Add the sliced onions, bell peppers, and carrots. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes, stirring constantly, until they start to soften slightly but are still crisp.\n3.  **Add Broccoli & Aromatics:** Add the broccoli florets, minced garlic, and grated ginger to the skillet. Stir-fry for another 3-5 minutes, until the broccoli is tender-crisp and bright green. If vegetables are getting too dry, add a splash of water or broth.\n4.  **Combine & Sauce:** Return the cooked chicken to the skillet with the vegetables. Give the stir-fry sauce a quick re-whisk (cornstarch settles at the bottom). Pour the sauce evenly over the chicken and vegetables.\n5.  **Thicken the Sauce:** Stir continuously for 1-2 minutes as the sauce simmers and thickens, coating all the ingredients. Cook until the sauce is glossy and coats everything nicely.\n\n**Phase 3: Serve**\n\n1.  Divide the warm rice among 4 plates or bowls.\n2.  Spoon a generous portion of the chicken and vegetable stir fry over the rice.\n3.  Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious homemade meal!\n\n---\n\n### **Beginner Tips & Variations:**\n\n*   **Don't Overcrowd:** This is the most important tip for stir-fries! Cooking in batches ensures your ingredients sear and develop flavor instead of steaming.\n*   **Heat Control:** Keep your heat high for stir-frying. If things start to burn, lower it slightly, but generally, high heat helps get that classic stir-fry char and quick cooking.\n*   **Vegetable Swap:** Feel free to swap or add other quick-cooking, nut-free vegetables like snap peas, sliced mushrooms, green beans, or baby corn. Just make sure to adjust cooking times slightly.\n*   **Spice It Up:** For a little heat, add a pinch of red pepper flakes along with the garlic and ginger, or serve with sriracha on the side.",

  "budget_advisor": "Okay, let's look at this shopping list for your Chicken Stir Fry and ensure it fits within your $25 budget, with some suggestions for potential savings.\n\nThe meal plan already estimates the cost at **~$20-25**, which is a great start! To ensure you stay firmly within or even under the $25 limit, here are some budget-savvy tips:\n\n### Budget Analysis & Savings Suggestions:\n\n1.  **Pantry Staples First (Major Savings Potential):**\n    *   **Check Your Pantry:** Before you even leave for the store, rigorously check for items like rice, soy sauce, cornstarch, brown sugar, vegetable oil, salt, and pepper. If you already have these, you'll save a significant amount! These can be the most expensive components if you're buying them all new.\n    *   **Optional Ingredients:** The recipe lists **Rice Vinegar** and **Sesame Oil** as optional. If your budget is tight, skip these for this first attempt. While they add depth, the dish will still be delicious without them, saving you a few dollars.\n    *   **Chicken Broth vs. Water:** The recipe states \"Water or Chicken Broth (for sauce, if not using water)\". **Use water**! You won't notice a huge difference in this dish, and it eliminates the need to buy broth.\n\n2.  **Smart Protein Choices:**\n    *   **Chicken Thighs vs. Breasts:** Often, boneless, skinless chicken thighs are less expensive per pound than boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Check the unit price (price per lb) at your store. Both work great in a stir-fry.\n    *   **Look for Sales:** Chicken is frequently on sale. If you can find 1.5 lbs on sale, that's a direct saving.\n\n3.  **Produce Section Tips:**\n    *   **Bulk Garlic/Ginger:** While the list specifies 4-5 cloves and a 1-inch piece of ginger, sometimes buying a whole head of garlic or a larger piece of ginger is more cost-effective if you plan to use them in other meals. Otherwise, just buy what you need.\n    *   **Seasonal Veggies:** While broccoli, carrots, and bell peppers are generally affordable, being aware of what's in season can sometimes lead to better prices on produce.\n\n4.  **Store Brands & Unit Pricing:**\n    *   **Store Brands:** For pantry items like soy sauce, rice, cornstarch, and even oil, opting for store brands (private label) can be significantly cheaper than national brands without sacrificing much, if any, quality.\n    *   **Unit Price:** Always look at the unit price (e.g., price per ounce or per 100g) on shelf labels, especially for items like rice, oils, and sauces, to compare and ensure you're getting the best value.\n\n### Estimated Cost Breakdown (Illustrative, prices vary by region/store):\n\n*   **1.5 lbs Chicken:** $6 - $9 (depending on cut and sales)\n*   **Produce (Broccoli, Carrots, Bell Pepper, Onion, Garlic, Ginger):** $7 - $10\n*   **Rice:** $1 - $2 (if buying a small bag, much less if you have it)\n*   **Soy Sauce:** $2 - $4 (if buying a new bottle, less if store brand)\n*   **Cornstarch:** $1 - $2 (if buying a new container, often very cheap)\n*   **Brown Sugar:** $1 - $2 (if buying new, often cheap)\n*   **Vegetable Oil:** ~$1 (for a small bottle if you don't have it)\n*   **Salt/Pepper:** Negligible if you have them.\n*   **Optional items (Rice Vinegar, Sesame Oil):** $3 - $6 (savings if skipped)\n*   **Chicken Broth:** $2 - $3 (savings if using water)\n\n**Total Estimated Range (buying most new, but skipping optional/broth):** $18 - $25\n\nBy actively applying the suggestions (especially checking your pantry, skipping optional ingredients, and using water instead of broth), you should comfortably be able to prepare this delicious meal for **under $25**, likely closer to the **$18-$22** range. Enjoy your stir-fry!",
